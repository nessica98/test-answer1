# BE-Q2

## **Assuming the team has started planning a new project, the project manager asks you for a performance test strategy plan for this release. How would you recommend proceeding to the project manager?**

The test step that I would like to recommend proceeding test plan to manager
1. Unit test: This is a test methodology that must be used in the very first step by the developer. The test should cover all the functions (especially the necessary utility functions that must be confirmed to have fewer bugs in the system).
2. End-to-end test: An end-to-end test makes the system run correctly along with desired use cases and business flow. Developers and QA should collaborate using this test methodology. The test case should cover all new features and make sure that the system can run with the existing system or legacy system.
3. Performance and security test: New projects should accept load size from users along with the requirement. We should know that the system can accept how much of the user load and usage in order to know the resource that will be used. Furthermore, system security is a necessary factor for one system. So that we should test system security to protect against malicious attacks from other attackers (hackers).
4. Usability: After the new features have been deployed. We should test the usability of the features in order to get feedback from users. This methodology helps us research user experience (UX) that can be used to develop new features after this.
