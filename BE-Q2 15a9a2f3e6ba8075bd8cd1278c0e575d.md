# BE-Q2

## **Assuming the team has started planning a new project, the project manager asks you for a performance test strategy plan for this release. How would you recommend proceeding to the project manager?**

The test step that I would like to recommend proceeding test plan to manager

1. Unit-test : This is a test methodology that must be used in the very first step by the developer. The test should be coverage all the function (especially, the necessary utils function that must be confirm that there is less bug in system)
2. End-to-end test : End-to-end test makes the system run correctly along with desired use cases and business flow. Developer and QA should collaborate using this test methodology. The test case should cover all new feature and make sure that system can run with exists system or legacy system
3. Performance and security test : New project should accept load-size from user along with the requirement. We should know that the system can accept how much of the user load and usage in order to know the resource that will be used. Furthermore, system security is a necessary factor for one system. So that we should test system security to protect against malicious attacks from other attackers (Hacker).
4. Usability: After the new features have been deployed. We should test the usability of the features in order to get feedback from users. This methodology helps us research user experience (UX) that can be used to develop new features after this.
